# Digiprank
Randomly-timed keypresses from a Digispark or compatible ATTINY85 board.

This code programs a Digispark-type board to simulate a USB keyboard and send the CAPS LOCk toggle value approximately every 10 minutes.

The code was developed using the Arduino IDE. If you need guidance on how to set up the ATTINY85 board in the IDE, see: https://digistump.com/wiki/digispark/tutorials/connecting
